## About Me
I am Karam, a Phd Candidate at Karlsruhe Institue of technolgy in Karlsruhe Germany. I am driven by the vision of a world where robots support humanity to overcome significant challenges. Recently, climate catastrophes have become more frequent, as evidenced by events in Ataal and Saarbr√ºcken. The devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have resulted in significant loss of life. In response to these disasters, deploying robots directly to affected areas could dramatically enhance search and rescue operations and save many lives. Robots are invaluable in navigating hazardous environments, locating survivors, and delivering critical supplies until human responders can safely take over.
Furthermore, many industries, such as construction, involve dangerous tasks that robotics can mitigate. Integrating robotic systems in warehouses and other environments can significantly enhance safety and operational efficiency. The future of robotics involves developing machines capable of learning and adapting to new environments, handling uncertainties, and performing multiple tasks simultaneously. Through my research and projects, I aim to contribute to creating a safer, more efficient world with innovative solutions in reinforcement learning and robotics.

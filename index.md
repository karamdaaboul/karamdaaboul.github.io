        <p>I'm Karam, a PhD candidate at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. My vision is driven by the idea of using robotics to help humans tackle monumental challenges. With the increasing frequency and intensity of events like the floods in Germany's Ahr Valley and the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, the application of advanced robotic systems in these scenarios is becoming crucial. I specialize in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and control theory. By leveraging the performance boosts and ability to solve complex tasks from the former and combining them with the prior knowledge and safety guarantees from the latter, we can build the next generation of robots to work in human-centered environments. During my PhD, I focused on model-based RL, safe RL, and meta RL to enhance robots' adaptability, safety, and effectiveness in unpredictable environments. My work aims to refine how robots learn and adapt, optimizing their deployment in multi-task, safety-critical scenarios.</p>

#### Project: Investigating the Strengths and Shortcomings of the RT-X Model in Robotic Manipulation (2024, german)
**Summary**: This project investigates the RT-1-X model in the context of robotic manipulation. The foundation model was trained on the Open X-Embodiment dataset. The sudents evaluate the model both in simulated and real environments, using a Franka Panda robot arm, to determine its capabilities and limitations. The RT-1-X model shows solid performance in in-distribution settings but fails to generalize to new, unseen tasks and environments without prior fine-tuning. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing distribution shifts, i.e., the visual differences between training and application environments. Despite the model's promising abilities in familiar scenarios, the investigation highlights the need for further research and development to improve the generalization ability of robotic learning models in diverse real-world applications.

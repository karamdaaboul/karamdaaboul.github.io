## Overview
This page provides summaries of various seminar works I have observed and contributed to during my PhD program. Each summary is followed by a link to the full document for those interested in more detailed information.

### Seminar 1: Enhancing the Robustness of Learning Directly from the Pixel
**Summary**: This seminar paper tackles the intrinsic challenges of pixel-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as significant sample inefficiency and limited ability to generalize across different environments. We delve into advanced machine-learning strategies designed to enhance the robustness and efficiency of pixel-based RL systems. The seminar highlights the application of contrastive learning to stabilize learning outcomes and improve algorithmic robustness against environmental variations. The seminar provides a structured overview of current advancements by categorizing various methodologies into groups based on their primary approach: data augmentation-only, time-utilizing, and view-utilizing approaches. These strategies collectively aim to bridge the significant gap between state-based and pixel-based RL, paving the way for their enhanced application in complex, real-world scenarios such as robotics and autonomous systems.

### Seminar 2: Model-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Robust Decision Making
**Summary**: This seminar explores the combination of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with meta-reinforcement learning (MRL) to address the challenges of adapting to new tasks with minimal data. This work considers various algorithmic strategies that enhance reinforcement learning systems' sample efficiency and adaptability. It focuses on a dynamic, real-time learning framework that allows robotic systems to adjust to changes in environment or task requirements swiftly. Through advanced meta-learning techniques, such as gradient-based and variational inference-based methods, this approach significantly reduces the amount of data required for training, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where data is scarce or costly to obtain. The seminar presents a detailed analysis of these methods, illustrating their potential to revolutionize adaptive behaviors in autonomous systems.

## Seminar Topics

### Meta Reinforcement Learning
<div id="meta-reinforcement-learning"></div>

#### Seminar: Model-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Robust Decision Making (2022)
**Summary**: This seminar explores the combination of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with meta-reinforcement learning (MRL) to address the challenges of adapting to new tasks with minimal data. It focuses on a dynamic, real-time learning framework that allows robotic systems to swiftly adjust to changes.

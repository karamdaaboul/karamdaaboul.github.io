## Overview
This page provides summaries of various seminar works I have observed and contributed to during my PhD program. Each summary is followed by a link to the full document for those interested in more detailed information.

### Seminar 1:- title: "Enhancing the Robustness of Learning Directly from the Pixel"
**Summary**: This seminar paper tackles the intrinsic challenges of pixel-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as significant sample inefficiency and limited ability to generalize across different environments. We delve into advanced machine-learning strategies designed to enhance the robustness and efficiency of pixel-based RL systems. The seminar highlights the application of contrastive learning to stabilize learning outcomes and improve algorithmic robustness against environmental variations. The seminar provides a structured overview of current advancements by categorizing various methodologies into groups based on their primary approach: data augmentation-only, time-utilizing, and view-utilizing approaches. These strategies collectively aim to bridge the significant gap between state-based and pixel-based RL, paving the way for their enhanced application in complex, real-world scenarios such as robotics and autonomous systems.

## Overview
This page presents our research on "Safe Continuous Control with Constrained Model-Based Policy Optimization," highlighting how constraints are integrated into reinforcement learning for safe robotic control. Our approach leverages the efficiency of model-based methods to optimize policies under these constraints effectively. This work was featured at the 2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2021).

## Research Highlights
Our research tackles the challenges of implementing safety constraints in reinforcement learning algorithms for robotic systems. We introduce a model-based safe exploration algorithm that reduces the high sample complexity typically associated with model-free approaches. The focus is on leveraging a learned model of system dynamics to enhance policy optimization under constraints, significantly reducing the number of training samples needed while maintaining safety.

- **Key Findings**:
Here are the enhanced key findings from the paper on "Safe Continuous Control with Constrained Model-Based Policy Optimization":

  1. **Boundary Formulation:** The paper introduces a performance boundary under model uncertainty, which quantifies the error due to discrepancies in state distribution and policy changes caused by model dynamics.

  2. **Model-based Adjustments:** It details how to accommodate model errors in policy optimization to ensure safety constraints are maintained, using trust-region methods that confine policy updates to areas where model predictions are deemed reliable.

  3. **Uncertainty Awareness:** The algorithm enhances safety by quantifying and incorporating model uncertainty awareness into the optimization process, using measures like the Kullback-Leibler divergence to manage and mitigate risks associated with inaccurate model predictions.

  4. **Practical Algorithm:** A practical algorithm is proposed that incorporates model uncertainty into the policy optimization process, ensuring both efficiency in learning and adherence to safety constraints.


- **Impact**:
  The methodology we've developed contributes to the broader field of robotics by enabling more efficient and safer automated systems, which are crucial as robots become increasingly integrated into human environments.
